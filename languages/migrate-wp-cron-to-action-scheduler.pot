msgid "By default, Action Scheduler will only process actions for a maximum of 30 seconds in each request. This time limit minimises the risk of a script timeout on unknown hosting environments, some of which enforce 30 second timeouts. If your host supports time limits longer than this for web requests, use this field to increase this time limit. This allows more actions to be processed in each request and reduces the lag between processing each queue, greatly speeding up the processing rate of scheduled actions."
