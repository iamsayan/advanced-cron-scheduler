== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to customize original post publication date format on frontend? =

To customize original post publication date, you need to add this following snippet to the end of your active theme's functions.php file:

`function wpar_override_time_format() {
    return 'F jS, Y \a\t h:i a';
}
add_filter( 'wpar/published_date_format', 'wpar_override_time_format' );`

= Will it work with my theme? =

Yes, our plugins work independently of themes you are using. As long as your website is running on WordPress, it will work.

= Are posts duplicated? =

By default, no. But you can configure it from plugin settings. The date on posts is updated to the current date making a post appear new. URLs don't change and comments continue to display with the post.

= Doesn't changing the timestamp affect permalinks that include dates?  =

Yes, permalinks with dates would be affected only in free version. This plugin shouldn't be used if your permalinks include dates since those dates will change when a post is republished. But in Premium version it is possible to use dates in permalinks.
